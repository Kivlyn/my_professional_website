  ### I  build impactful data products that help companies improve decision making with a positive impact on the bottom line.

  I enjoy enabling data analysts and data scientists whenever possible. I believe in training and building people. In my spare time I enjoy getting closer to family.

  My main focus is leveraging data science to benefit businesses. I create value for organisations by analysing the financial implications of challenges and delivering solutions that yield a positive return on investment. I find great fulfillment in continual learning, collaborating with stakeholders, and using data to drive improved decision-making.
